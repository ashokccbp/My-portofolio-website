Features
The portfolio website includes the following key sections:

Hero Section:
Displays my full name and role (e.g., Web Developer).
Features an engaging background.
Includes a call-to-action button.
About Section:
Provides a short introduction paragraph about myself.
Showcases a profile picture.
Projects Section:
Highlights 2-3 sample projects.
Each project includes a title, preview image/screenshot, short description, and a link (to GitHub or a placeholder).
Contact Section:
A simple contact form with fields for Name, Email, and Message.
Includes basic JavaScript validation for empty fields and valid email format.
Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla)
Styling Framework: [Mention if you used Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap, e.g., "Tailwind CSS"]
3D Integration: Spline
Deployment: Vercel
3D Integration
The portfolio website incorporates a 3D model/scene using Spline.

Method: A pre-built 3D scene from https://spline.design is embedded into the website using the provided iframe/export code.
Placement: The 3D scene is integrated within the [Hero/Projects - Choose the correct one based on your implementation] section, adding an interactive and visually appealing element to the page.
Project Structure
The project follows a clean and organized folder structure for maintainability:

my-portofolio-website/

│   ├── images/
│   └── ...

(Adjust the above structure to accurately reflect your repository's organization.)

Setup and Installation
To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
Bash

git clone https://github.com/ashokccbp/My-portofolio-website.git
Navigate into the project directory:
Bash

cd My-portofolio-website
Open index.html in your web browser: You can simply open the index.html file directly in your browser, or use a local development server (e.g., Live Server VS Code extension) for hot reloading.
Deployment
The portfolio website is deployed on Vercel.

Deployment Steps (if applicable for a user trying to deploy):

Ensure you have a Vercel account.
Install the Vercel CLI: npm i -g vercel
Navigate to the project root in your terminal.
Run vercel and follow the prompts to link your project and deploy.
Responsive Design
The website is designed to be fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. Media queries and flexible layouts have been utilized to ensure seamless adaptation.

Code Quality
Clean and Readable: The codebase prioritizes readability and maintainability, with clear variable names and logical flow.
Comments: Meaningful comments are added throughout the code to explain complex sections and functionality.
Modular: Efforts have been made to keep the code modular, separating concerns where appropriate (e.g., CSS, JavaScript).
Optional (Bonus) Integrations
While not implemented in this specific project version, here's a description of how similar 3D integration could be achieved using other technologies:

WordPress Integration
For WordPress, 3D integration could be approached in several ways:

Plugin-based embedding: Utilizing existing WordPress plugins designed for 3D model viewers (e.g., some plugins support glTF/GLB file uploads and rendering).
Custom Theme Development: Integrating Three.js or Spline directly into a custom WordPress theme's template files. This would involve enqueuing necessary JavaScript libraries and rendering the 3D scene within the theme's HTML structure.
iFrame Usage: Similar to the current Spline implementation, embedding a 3D scene within an <iframe> directly into a page or post content.
Node.js Integration
For Node.js, integrating 3D models typically involves frontend rendering with libraries like Three.js:

Three.js with Express for backend-rendered pages: While the 3D rendering itself would occur client-side, a Node.js Express backend could serve the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that contain the Three.js logic. The server would manage routes and deliver the necessary assets for the browser to render the 3D scene.
React-based frontend: If the frontend is built with React (or another framework like Vue/Angular), a Node.js backend would serve the React application. Three.js or Spline could then be integrated within React components using libraries like react-three-fiber for Three.js, or by directly embedding Spline iframes/exports within a component. The Node.js backend would primarily act as an API server if dynamic data for the portfolio was needed.
